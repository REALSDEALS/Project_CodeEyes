# Project_CodeEyes - Description
Project CodeEyes is a Discord bot that implements all the basic features of what a bot needs and could do. So you won't have to install more than one bot in your Discord.

# Project_CodeEyes - Credits
This project is being made by REALSDEALS and all the people that might help me with this idea. 
People who actively help will get credit where credit is due, in the follow-up/final version of this readme.

# Project_CodeEyes - Instructions and How to
This will get updated when the Bot is working as it should with most of it's base functions working.

# Project_CodeEyes - Features (Future) 
Features we are hoping to include in the final version are; reacting on user input, kick and ban users on command, being able to play music, being able to talk/type through and the list might get bigger...

# It may be...
That this project will be canceled, or maybe be updated later this year.
So for now there is an hold on this project, this is because I'm currently busy with other projects.

Altough I'm busy with other projects, I'm also very busy in 'Real-Life,' I have a lot going on what I've to adress first.
I find it very sad that I can't work on this Project, but I hope that don't offend people or dissapoint people.

With kind regards,

REALSDEALS
